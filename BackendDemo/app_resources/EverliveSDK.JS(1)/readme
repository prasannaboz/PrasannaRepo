Everlive JavaScript SDK

The 'min' folder contains the minified versions of the SDK files.

To use the SDK and its dependencies as a single file, add this tag to your markup:
	<script src="path/to/everlive.all.min.js"></script>
In case you have already referenced some of the dependencies, you can include each file you need separately:
	<script src="path/to/reqwest.min.js"></script>
	<script src="path/to/underscore.min.js"></script>
	<script src="path/to/rsvp.min.js"></script>
	<script src="path/to/jstz.min.js"></script>
	<script src="path/to/everlive.min.js"></script>
	<script src="path/to/kendo.data.everlive.min.js"></script>

The 'src' folder contains the source files of the libraries which can be used in development environment.
